|   1  |      [Betsutenjin](https://www.yelp.com/biz/betsu-ten-jin-seattle)     |   Hakata Style Ramen with Lobster Salad Combo  |                                 The ramen is a 7~8 (depends on the day), but the lobster salad is really good.                                |   8~9  |
|   2  |             [Ooink](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ooink-seattle)            |                   Shoyu Ramen                  |                         I can't remember why I liked this place. Been 2 years since I've been. Will update this later.                        |    8   |
|   3  |  [Ramen Man](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-man-noodle-house-seattle)  |                   Garlic Shio                  |                                 Eggs aren't marinated, but infinite eggs. Pretty good value if you're near by.                                |   7~8  |
| 4    | [Kizuki](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kizuki-ramen-and-izakaya-bellevue-9) | Low Sodium Garlic Tonkotsu Ramen with Takoyaki | Too much garlic and salt for regular, too much garlic for low sodium. Takoyaki is pretty good, but it can be pretty dry. Depends on location. | 6      |
| 5    | [Jinya](https://www.yelp.com/biz/jinya-ramen-bar-bellevue)             | Don't go here.                                 | Nothing stands out, and they're not cheap either.                                                                                             | 4      |
