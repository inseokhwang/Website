New year, new me.

I'm writing a new blog to keep track of what I'm reading, learning, and eating. Primarily to help me remember what I've done in the past, secondarily to learn how to use Markdown/Jekyll again.  Hope you enjoy my content.

The website's built using Jekyll and Aigar Dzerviniks' theme, [Brume](https://github.com/aigarsdz/brume), hosted on Github.
